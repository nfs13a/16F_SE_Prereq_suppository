Lessons Learned
Steven:
-Test with mac earlier. 
-Chromebooks are terrible for programming.
-Powershell is actually useful. Batch files even moreso.
-Small commitments at each demo works out well. Prioritization helped keep things relatively manageable.
-Failsoft. Don't make brittle programs.
-Test/optimize for actual data sooner. Testing with big csv would have been more beneficial earlier if we'd figured out how to not make it take hours.
-Write test first/sooner. Most of our work had tests written first, but a bit of it was done backwards with tests afterwards.
-Making the interface out of cucumber sooner isn't difficult, but could have been done sooner.

Nevan:
-We should start divying up work to be done over the weekend. We do not want to meet, but we need to use the time.
-Some iterations are short than others in this class, and that should affect our work schedule.
-Make sure to always start an iteration with cucumber.
-Work for less time on more days rather than for more time on fewer days.
-Things always take longer.

Preston:
-Doing things takes time, so start doing things sooner.
-Think about possible ways the program may fail.
-Teamwork is important to success on a project.
-Write enough tests to thoroughly cover possible cases
