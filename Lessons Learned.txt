Lessons Learned
-Test with mac earlier. 
-Chromebooks are terrible for programming.
-Powershell is actually useful. Batch files even moreso.
-Small commitments at each demo works out well. Prioritization helped keep things relatively manageable.
-Failsoft. Don't make brittle programs.
-Test/optimize for actual data sooner. Testing with big csv would have been more beneficial earlier if we'd figured out how to not make it take hours.
-Write test first/sooner. Most of our work had tests written first, but a bit of it was done backwards with tests afterwards.
-Making the interface out of cucumber sooner isn't difficult, but could have been done sooner.
