We view our project as being divided into 5 main categories or, if you will, 5 stories in our epic:

1. transcript
2. catalog
3. roster
4. connection of 1-3
5. parser

Not each requires as many man-hours as another, but they are clear divisions in the end goal, the product. We have finished the first two and are aiming to finish 3 and 4 by demo 2. Given the large scope of 5, we feel that we have finished about one-third of the overall project, and we are aiming to be done with two-thirds by demo 2.
