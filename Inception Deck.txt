Q: Why are we here?
A: To provide a product to professors that does a service. Service: reporting all students in a given class that do not meet the prerequesites

Q: Elevator pitch
A: We are developing a command line tool to help professors sort out which students don't belong in their classes, due to a lack or prereqs. Information on the students and the relevant information from their transcripts are taken from a csv and when the professor uses the tool can be quickly brought up from a database to weed out those that don't belong there.
